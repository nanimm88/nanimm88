<summary>Tips for collapsed sections</summary>

### You can add a header

You can add text within a collapsed section. 

You can add an image or a code block, too.

```ruby
   puts "Hello World"
```

</details>

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

````
```
Look! You can see my backticks.
```
````

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```ASP.NET
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

Here is a simple flow chart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
